  "Children will learn how to make sense of the basic principles of programming, create games and cartoons in Scratch Junior, approach problem-solving creativity, talk about their projects in front of the group confidence and work in a team on joint tasks and projects.",
  "This is a skill that every modern child needs. Children will learn how to work with text documents and type fast, put together presentations, prepare oral presentation, present information in the form of tablets and infographics, search for trustworthy information online and project their personal data, register on websites, and use email and cloud storage services. They will also learn how to work with a graphical editor and create digital pictures.",
  "Children will learn about the basic concepts and practices involved in programming (from creating algorithms to correcting errors). They will learn how to create cartoons and games in the block-based programming language scratch, making their stories more sophisticated as their knowledge grows. They will finally learn how to apply the main principles of graphic design and vector graphics in practice. They will also learn how to work in team, not to fear public speaking and confidently present their projects in front a live audience.",
  "This course is very interesting for children. They learn how to develop designs in Figma and create websites in the block-based builder, Tilda. They will learn how to write HTML and CSS code, publish their website using GitHub pages. They will create designs for interfaces and adapt their websites for mobile devices.",
  "This course normally takes two years to complete the whole program taking into account that itâ€™s a part-time curriculum. This is the course that teaches children to start programming on a serious and solid note. Teenagers will learn to understand the basics of algorithms and object-oriented; develop interactive graphical games for PCs using the PyGame library; work with graphics and use the Turtle library. They will also learn how to solve real tasks using Python and apply an interactive approach.",
  "This is the bridge course to professionalism. This two years course will enable children to code in Python and test their skills in the most sough-after IT fields from game development to machine learning expertise. During the second year, children will be introduced to the world of 3D games, design scenes and animate characters. They will also learn how to develop mobile applications and they will acquire other interesting skills.",
